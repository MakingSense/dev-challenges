## Evaluation Criteria

When looking at a solution, we know that it is not a completed project. We also know that there is a very short amount of time to complete it, so this is what we're hoping to look for.

- Technical skills:
    - Identify the tools that you chose to use, and how you used them.
    - Look at the code you wrote, and if it's tidy, organized, and how.
    - How extensible the solution is.
    - How maintainable the solution is.
    - Application design according to best practices.
    - Abilities with version management.
    - How do you deal with missing technical requirements (e.g. if you develop a FE solution, how do you deal with the BE not being available).
- Non-technical skills:
    - How did you communicate intent.
    - How did you identify technical debt.
    - How did you communicate technical debt.
    - How you made sense of a vague requirement, lacking detail.
    - Use of language to communicate to fellow developers.
    - Use / non-use of comments.
