# Welcome to Making Sense's Dev Challenges!

Welcome!

This project will help us identify your strengths so we can create an accurate career path for you.

Please select your challenge, create a repository for your project, and send it to us so we can check it out!

- [React challenges](React/README.md)
- [Angular 1.x challenges](Angular1.x/README.md)
- [NetCore challenges](NetCore/README.md)

You have up to *72hs* to deliver the finished challenge.

Everything will be evaluated, technical and non-technical skills. Show us what you've got!

Tip: if you don't know something make your best guess or assumption, we want to know how you think.

Remember: Create a new repository for your project. When you are ready, send it to us so we can check it out!

The Development Team wishes you luck, and we hope to have you working with us soon!

May the code be with you.
