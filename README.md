# Welcome to Making Sense's UI Challenge!

Young Padawan,

The idea behind this project is, mainly, to help us identify your strengths so we can create an accurate career path for you.

Your task will be to create the main structure, layout and look&feel of a landing page taking these tips into consideration:

* Create a fork of this repository. When you are ready to deliver the project, create a pull request so we can check it out.
* The mockup is a fully editable and layered .png file created in Adobe Fireworks.
* Use `HTML` and `CSS`.
* You can use `Javascript`, but transitions and animations should be CSS-only.
* It's desirable that you use a CSS pre-processor during the development. At Making Sense we use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).
* You can use any CSS Frameworks/UI Toolkits you desire (Bootstrap, Foundation, Gumby), but we value clean code overall.
* Responsive mockups are not designed on purpose. We would like to see how you can come up with a mobile version on your own.
* Among other things, we'd love to see how and when you make use of transitions, animations and different CSS units.

You have up to 72hs to deliver the finished challenge.

UI development team wish you luck, and we hope to have you working with us soon!

Damián Muti,
Head of UI.
