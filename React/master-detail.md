# Marvel master-detail exercise

Use the Marvel API and create a small app that:

- Lists superheroes
- Allows the user to select one and look at details of the superhero

The listing should have:

- The superhero name
- The superhero image
- A flag indicating if this superhero appears in any comics or not
- A flag indicating if this superhero appears in any series or not
- A flag indicating if this superhero appears in any event or not
- A flag indicating if this superhero appears in any story or not

The detailed view should have:

- The superhero name
- The superhero image
- The biography of the superhero
- Any links available for the superhero (`urls`)

## Suggestions

Here are a few suggestions, but not requirements. Feel free to do them or not.

- Have the app done in two columns: a small one to the left with the listing and a large one on the right with the detail
- Implement deep-linking
- Prepare your app to have the API Key configurable (maybe as part of a release process?)
- Setup some tests for your app
- Document any decisions that you'd like to communicate, why you thought of taking some approach (maybe in a README.md?)
